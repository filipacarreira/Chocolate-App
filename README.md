Chocolate is a widely appreciated candy all over the world, but especially in Europe. 16 of the top 20 countries that consume the most chocolate are European and Portugal is not an exception.
Having in mind our love for chocolate, we decided to analyse a dataset with information about different chocolates around the world. Our goal was to create a dashboard for every chocolate lover, with interactive visualizations using Plotly and Dash as software tools. In this dashboard, we wanted to make sure that the user could obtain all information about chocolate possible to find the perfect chocolate for them, based on their choices.

So, to all the fellow chocolate lovers, we hope you like it!
